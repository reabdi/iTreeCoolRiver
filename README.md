# iTreeCoolRiver
the mechanistic i-Tree Cool River Model can simulate the effect of inflows from surface and subsurface areas and shading from riparian areas on simulated river temperature. 

Highlights
•	The i-Tree Cool River Model mechanistically simulates temperature in rivers. 
•	Storm event simulations represent the warming effect of runoff from impervious areas.
•	Riparian shading diminishes warming and subsurface inflows provide a cooling effect.
•	C++ code uses Gaussian elimination linear interpolation for matrix operations.
